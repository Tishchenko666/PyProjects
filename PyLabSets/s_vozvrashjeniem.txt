After all, all these secret societies and groupings are alike. Avengers, Rebirth and others, what else was there? Some sincerely believe that they managed to deceive an organization that literally controls the entire area and the port. Others come to bow and believe that their true intentions remain a mystery to the boss of the Port Mafia. Mori Ogai does not interfere with either one or the other. He even lets some people into Yokohama himself - just like with the current group - when they can play into his hands in order to obtain some valuable document ...
Or meeting with an important person.
There are very few people in the world that Mori really appreciates, those whom he can trust - even less. Just two, to be honest. They are not part of the Port Mafia, but are strongly associated with the shadow world.
Morey would never have accepted them into the Port Mafia. For their own safety.
The familiar number is hidden in the depths of the memory of the second phone. The device is intended for only two rooms closely related to each other.
- Mmm?
Mori smiles unwillingly as he imagines the person on the other end of the wire stretching. Like a cat, with a stretch and pleasure from straightening muscles, from your own flexibility.
- Didn't you wake up?
Not really. I don't care to get up in five minutes.
- Sorry. Will you come to visit me?
Of course.
Mori puts her phone down and calls the servants to prepare the room for the arrival of the guest.
There are two rooms in his apartment, which are forbidden to enter in the absence of their owners. Guest bedrooms decorated in beige colors. Wide beds, floor-to-ceiling windows, exquisite linens, clogged wardrobes. Everything is thought out, right down to the toothbrush. The owners of these rooms should feel welcome and welcome in Mori's home.
The meeting takes place unhurriedly as always. Hirotsu and Koe have been in the mafia for a long time, they understand that things are not done quickly. This is why Dazai and Chuuya are not here right now. Hot youth, prefer to act or force others to act, without delay. They don't yet know what patience is, but if Mori is correct in his calculations, they will have to learn.
Falling through the glass wall overlooking the bay, the sun falls on the colorful silk of Koe's kimono, on the elaborate embroidered patterns. The glass of wine in the graceful hand of the woman casts ruby ​​as Hirotsu slowly and clearly reports what has already been done to calculate the identity of the opponent. Mori hardly listens, after all, personalities are not so important to him, because he let them into Yokohama. But it would be curious to know who is hiding under the inconspicuous cloaks.
The door opens inaudibly. Mori looks up with a slight smile. There are only three people who have the right to shamelessly interrupt any meeting. Alice is currently drawing something important in the next room, they remain ...
A teenage girl stands on the threshold. High-waisted black shorts, a light belt that hangs down almost to the ground like a predator's tail. Uneven bangs like a stepped waterfall turn into a long strand and go down to the shoulder. The rest of the girl is neat. The square is just above the shoulder line, ballet flats on small feet, fingerless gloves on narrow palms. Near a sharp knee, a suitcase on wheels, small, for close trips, was huddled.
- I hope it didn't interfere?
Something rises, rustles its sleeves, joyfully throwing up its hands.
- Atsushi, - the woman takes a step forward, while the girl comes closer, sits on the sofa next to her. - How did you grow up, - gently runs his fingertips on his cheek, looks with maternal warmth.
Children Something nature did not give, so a woman gives all her love to close girls.
- You will become a real beauty.
Atsushi blushes charmingly, her naturally pale cheeks are filled with blush with an even, thin layer, like soft pink silk, the haze of dawn in heaven.
- Thank you, Koe, - ballet flats remain on the floor, the girl bends her legs under her. - What happened?
- Can you help to find out the identities of some very active violators? Mori smiles thinly.
Atsushi nods, takes out a laptop - a gadget with a palm the size, but the power is equal to five newfangled, full-fledged systems
- Tsuna spoke, so I already started calculating.
An interactive screen is displayed above the computer, symbols and pictures are running across it, Atsushi periodically clicks on them, but mostly rustles the keyboard. Someone looks with pleasure as thin fingers flutter, the edge of the wide sleeve of her robe now and then touches the shoulder and delicate neck of the girl.
- Found it, - Atsushi turns the screen to Mori. He reads an almost complete dossier and analytical calculations on the group. Yes, Atsushi started working long ago, but still the speed is amazing.
- You asked for photographs of corpses for this.
The girl leans back on the sofa, mechanically stroking the computer. Her lilac eyes shine with slyness and pleasure from the task. Self-realization is at times the best stimulant or aphrodisiac - depending on age - for a person.
- On video from street cameras you can see that they work professionally. In a military way, clearly. At the same time, they are well versed in a foreign country, know how to hide better and where. This speaks of the international military experience, at least one-time and many years of teamwork. Ordinary army men would not hide their faces and so openly run up, most likely, exiles or war criminals. Those who are ashamed to show their faces, who cannot just leave without fighting. In the military, everything is very clearly tied to honor, - Mori likes to listen to Atsushi's arguments, they are incomplete, but a man can read between the lines. What she didn't say, what she thought. Atsushi understands him, probably knows about his involvement in the events, but does not interfere - which is especially valuable. - It remains only to look through the military scandals of recent years and more closely look at the networks of these countries. It is impossible to completely erase photographs in our age of information technologies, anyway they are somewhere, but they will remain. Specifically, these are in old family photographs posted on the network. The members of the group there lit up briefly, in the background, but this was enough for the recognition program.
Mori closes his eyes. This is beyond the power of anyone without the appropriate equipment, Atsushi has it - a gift from Verde, Arcobaleno Storm. The most powerful technique, learn about which companies, with their hands would be ripped off. Atsushi doesn't shine, not always.
Soon, Koe and Hirotsu leave in understanding, leaving Mori alone with an old friend.
It is ridiculous to imagine that he, a seasoned mafioso, was once saved by two little girls. But he still remembers Tsunayoshi's serious, adult look, as if she were many hundreds of years old. And Atsushi's naive smile, claiming that he is a good person. Mori lived in Namimori for two months before his wounds healed.
- How is Tsuna?
- As always - Atsushi puts the computer in his pocket.
Mori grows gloomy. He himself accepts every attempt with a smile, but his soul becomes dreary when he sees his friends carelessly talking about their enemies.
- Are you still being pursued?
- Yes. And soon the game will come to its end.
They talked about this more than once. Mori seemed like Tsunayoshi was trying to prepare him that way. With a carefree smile, she reported death at every meeting.
- Dostoevsky is very persistent in his desire to gain control over the Triniset system. For some reason, he believes that the book that Tsunayoshi keeps is the key to fulfilling desires.
- This is not true? - Mori already knows the answer.
Atsushi shakes his head, and a gentle strand glides silkily over the thin skin.
- Biography of the first Arcobaleno Heaven, the only one of the damned who did not become a baby and lived with a dummy for about two hundred years.
- Why don't you tell Dostoevsky about this?
In response, the friend looks like an adult, tired and tender.
- Would you believe that the coveted prize is not really what you dream of? - long eyelashes fan out on the cheeks, covering the radiance of the two-tone eyes. When Atsushi picks them up again, her gaze is meek resignation.
- Notes...
- I am the Keeper, I open access to the book. By your death.
Mori clenched a fist against his will, a glove wrapped around sharp knuckles. The housekeeper ... the book ... In fact, Atsushi is the bodyguard, the last step on the way to the ancient manuscript hiding in Tsunayoshi's body.
This is not their first conversation, but something tells: the last. It is difficult to argue with a Shaman who sees the future. Mori knows that Tsunayoshi overlooked all possibilities in order to keep Atsushi safe. Atsushi responded by calculating all the scenarios to save Tsuna. As always, one thinks about the other more than about herself, and as a result, both will die.
- Is there a chance for you to be saved?
And he didn't expect an answer at all:
- Yes,- Mori looks up, Atsushi confirms with a nod. - Yes, and not small. But in this case, we will lose strength and memory, yet Dostoevsky is strong.
- The Vongola will take advantage of Tsunayoshi's helplessness.
Atsushi shrugs nonchalantly in response.
- Let be. Nobody says that it will not burn out completely.
Early in the morning, from Oda came a report on the investigation into Ango's disappearance. Morey drummed his fingers on the table. Events are developing at the right pace and direction, however, an uncomfortable thought still worries, itching at the very edge of consciousness.
- Atsushi.
The girl comes out of the bathroom in short shorts and a snow-white shirt with a small flower - Mori categorically does not accept the desire to sleep in T-shirts, so everything in the closets in the rooms is only cute and girlish. Atsushi doesn't mind, Tsunayoshi laughs and cuts off the ruffles.
One of the girl's cheeks is swollen with a toothbrush, on the other, the trace of the pillow is still turning pink.
- Eh, I’d be a couple of years younger, - Mori sighs dreamily.
Atsushi snorts laughingly and goes to the bathroom.
- You wouldn’t benefit from my strength anyway, I’m a contactee, - a cheerful voice can be heard through the pouring water.
Ohio nods in agreement and goes to make coffee.
For some reason, his power did not work on Tsunayoshi and Atsushi. Probably, it's all about the Triniset system, which protects its darlings. Mori could never force Atsushi to do anything, to protect him. The girl always did everything of her own free will, which made her appreciate her even more.
Mori's sex life is a double-edged blade. His power - Alice - is always nearby, protective, destructive and beautiful in its power. Never grows old, stays young and fresh. Mori is simply not able to look towards other women, they are not interested in him.
It was only about Atsushi that he once thought what a beauty the girl would become in the future.
Here she is also an exception.
Mori Ogai loves thin-walled porcelain, so thin it seems to crack with an awkward sigh. Graceful cups filled with an exquisite drink, black as the night itself.
But among this splendor on the shelves there is a large mug with a tiger cub. Fat, a little awkward compared to the beauties from the expensive sets, bought at a sale. However, nothing in the world will make Mori throw her away.
- Four tablespoons of sugar and cream, - Atsushi holds out her portion that might pass for a full breakfast.
- Thank you, - still in her night suit, the girl sits down on a chair, bends her leg under her. And Mori enjoys the homely atmosphere that her presence alone creates.
Atsushi hisses and wrinkles his nose as the hot drink burns the sensitive tongue. A pink, pointed tip flickers when the mouth is parted to allow air to cool the affected area. It’s always like that, Atsushi is physically unable to wait for the drink to cool down a little.
Toast is added to coffee with jam, necessarily cherry jam, Atsushi simply adores it. More only the chocolate nut butter, for which he and Alice are constantly vying. There used to be scrambled eggs and bacon for breakfast, but Mori weaned him from spoiling his body in the morning.
Someday when she grows up ... I wonder if she will also come to him?
Mori doesn't want to think that there will be no one to come. Atsushi and Tsuna will get out, after all, they are not the first time to lead their pursuers by the nose.
He can offer help and knows that it will not be accepted. On the contrary, the intervention of the Port Mafia will only worsen the situation.
- Will you back up something? - he asks instead.
Atsushi nods. Sleepy Alice crawls out of the bedroom, sticks her nose into her friend's cup, frowns and goes to the fridge on the machine, rattles with something, takes out a can of pasta and two large spoons. Mori enjoys her friend's quiet laugh as two heads bent over one can. And he almost misses the answer:
- Of course.
- The ground is completely burnt out. - Hirotsu's voice sounds professionally restrained, but Mori hears a sad note, hidden, hidden. One of the oldest members of the mafia loved girls, considered them his family, even if they did not come often. - The body was found, according to preliminary examination, it belongs to a girl of fourteen or fifteen years old. It is not possible to establish an identity.
Yes exactly. Tsuna's flame devours everything in its path, there are no barriers for it.
- Thank. Come back.
- Yes.
Mori throws her head back in the chair. Tsunayoshi stands in front of his eyes with disheveled whirlwinds, Tsunaeshi in an apron and with an oven mitt. Atsushi's voice in my head draws familiar: "Mori-i-sa-a-an". Atsushi smiles and wrinkles his nose, Atsushi laughs. Atsushi bandages his wounds. Atsushi transforms into a small tiger cub in Tsuna's arms.
- Mori?
Alice rarely calls him by name. A girl in a beautiful dress sits on the floor near the armchair, holds the armrest with her hands and stretches like a small dog for a weasel. Her eyes shine with tears ready to shed. Now there is no ridicule and the usual slightly aggressive sarcasm in it. It's scary, to be honest.
- Mori?
Ohi puts his hand on the girl's silk curls, fingering them affectionately.
- They’re alive, you’ll see. You just need to look for them.
Alice nods and presses her cheek to the man's knee, rubs. She also hopes.
Mori knows that Tsuna and Atsushi couldn't just die. If only one body ... Perhaps the second survived ... But who?
- Something, come to me.
Oda doesn't understand how he managed to survive. The last thing he remembers is Dazai's hands, his desperate eyes, his bitten lip. Last words - he asked a friend to leave the mafia.
The enemy was defeated, the children were avenged, and Oda believed that everything was over for him. But here he is again in the hospital ward of the Port Mafia, bandaged, under IVs, which are more for show - Sakunosuke does not feel sick or crushed. Only broken.
A rustling sound is heard from the side, and the light of the lamps obscures the dark silhouette. It takes a while for Oda to recognize the boss. Mori stares coldly, with a sneer, however, as always.
- Come on up, I have a little surprise for you.
Sakunosuke obediently sits up in bed. The muscles that have relaxed during the period of inactivity ache, but the man cannot notice anything critical. As if they had not shot at him, had not tried to beat him. So he drops his feet, fumbles for slippers and a hospital gown. Will have time to change clothes, the boss does not like to wait.
They walk down a bright, deserted corridor until Mori leads him to a residential apartment. My head is a little dizzy, but every minute it becomes easier to walk.
The boss's back is straight, as if he had swallowed a stick. Sakunosuke could never understand Mori's thoughts from his eternally calm face, but today he can probably tell that the boss is sad and slightly upset.
The doors swing open as if by magic, Mori makes an inviting hand and Oda walks past him. Nothing is interesting anymore, not after the death of the children, whom he did not save. Their screams, their faces distorted by the flames stand before our eyes ...
The heart stops, it stops almost to a heart attack. His children sleep side by side on the carpet in a large room, among toys and attachments. Sakunosuke recognizes those naughty whirlwinds, those crooked braids everywhere. The man quickly hobbles forward, it is important for him to make sure that all this is not a dream, not a hallucination caused by blood loss and painkillers.
Hot breath settles on the palm of your hand, hearts beat evenly and strongly. Everyone has it. Oda turns around helplessly at the boss. Now it becomes clear how Andre found out about the children's shelter. Just ... why? Mori Ogai is not prone to mercy. Why did he save?
- You needed motivation, otherwise you would never have used your abilities, - the boss chuckles, walks into the room and hangs over the children as a shadow. - They will be provided with the best conditions, schools, institutes that they choose. All at the expense of the Port Mafia. I will personally oversee their safety. But in return, you will go on a secret mission, indefinite, and you will not contact anyone but me until the time comes.
Oda didn't think for a minute. The boss could have just ordered, but chose to buy loyalty instead. He knew that Sakunosuke would go to great lengths for the sake of the children, even the hated murder.
- When the time comes?
Mori's thin lips parted in a cheerless, evil grin.
- Oh, you yourself will understand. Until then, you will send reports to me personally via an internal channel. Once a week.
- Where should I go?
- Namimori. Your goal is to keep an eye on this child.
In the photo, a pretty girl with disheveled brown hair and not at all Japanese-style brown eyes. In her smile, the sun and summer, innocence and naivety, in her eyes are her childish wisdom. How is she related to Dr. Mori? Really a daughter? In this case, they are not very similar.
- Can I contact the object?
Common practice prohibits this, but it seems that the child is really special.
- Yes, but secretly. You must remain a secret to everyone except Sawada Tsunayoshi.
Sakunosuke nods and bows, ignoring his aching ribs.
- Yes, boss.
Mori's children were sent to a closed school under the control of the mafia. No one would harm them there, and Sakunosuke would be able to check on their condition and study if he chose. Maury promised to take care.
Sawada Tsunayoshi was found on the border of Namimori. Numerous cuts and bruises, concussion, as a result, amnesia. But she's alive, that's the main thing. Even if she never remembers herself, the Port Mafia will secretly keep an eye on her. Mori still hoped for the best.
Dazai left the Mafia in the belief that Sakunosuke was alive. So be it. Of course, had the performer stayed, the mafia would have taken control of not only one city, it would have flourished. But Dazai made his point clear. Never mind, two years before joining the agency will teach him patience. And in the future, the boy will contribute to the unification of the two esper organizations. A thin world is better than a good quarrel.
Mori sighed and clutched the silver bracelet in his hand. He found it on the nightstand after Atsushi left.
All that remains of her.
But if Tsuna survived, maybe ... Atsushi too.
He will wait.

Four years later.
- So you came to propose an alliance? - Mori looked at the Agency staff.
The director clenched his jaw but nodded. Morey smiled with a kind shark grin. Fukuzawa Yukichi was respected by the boss for his integrity, combat and organizational skills. For making the Agency a force to be reckoned with.
Dazai looked over his shoulder defiantly. As Mori had anticipated, the boy realized the benefits of the union and led the situation to a union. Now it would be fun to turn around, refuse, and then still help, make, so to speak, a contribution to the future. Into the future of the second black duo. Maury liked this initiative even more. It was a chance for him to get close to the esper he was interested in. Remembering nothing esper. By the way, where is she?
A slender maiden figure flew out of the bushes. Morey recognized the high-waisted shorts, the long belt, the uneven bangs. At first, it was a mockery for him, Koe and Hirotsu. Atsushi didn't remember anything, but she unknowingly copied her past style.
Now the girl was gasping for breath, flushed from a fast run.
- Atsushi, you should be resting with Akiko now! Dazai worried.
The girl did not even look at him, her gaze did not leave the mafia boss. She took a step forward, and Mori's subordinates became agitated, tensed. He waved his hand to calm down. My heart was beating faster, my lips were dry with excitement. Really? He almost despaired, for four years Tsuna did not remember anything. Well, at least made friends with Odasaku.
- Mori-i-sa-an, what, don't you even offer coffee? - she bows her head, a strand slides over the shirt.
- With four tablespoons of sugar and cream?
- And in my mug.
Mafia and detectives do not understand anything, they look at each other and what is happening with bewilderment. Atsushi steps forward with every word until the wind-swept belt touches Mori's hand. He intercepts a strip of fabric and pulls on himself, which is why the girl flies into the arms with all her might. Ohi squeezes her, he had no idea how bored he was in four years.
Atsushi grew up to be a beauty, as she had prophesied once. Tall, slender, with a strong chest, narrow hips. And the most amazing eyes in the world.
- Book again? he asks knowingly.
- Not only. - Atsushi pulls back slightly, as far as Mori's hands allow. - Now Dostoevsky wants to destroy both the Mafia and the Agency.
- What a nice boy, - the boss mutters to himself.
- I think it means union, - the director intervenes.
Mori looks at the man over Atsushi's shoulder.
- Definitely.

- Bring it in here! Install the drip.
Mafiosi are dragging equipment into the boss's bedroom. He lies on the canopy bed on which the previous leader died. On the wall, above the headboard, there are blood splashes, dried up, darkened with age.
Hirotsu and Koe do not pay attention, the man directs the installation of the equipment, the woman restrains Alice, distraught with excitement.
Cursed poison! Damned Dostoevsky!
- What's here? .. - A girl in a nightgown and short shorts peeps out of the next room.
Chuuya recognizes the Agency tigress.
- What the hell did you forget here?
The girl does not answer, looks questioningly at Koe and Hirotsu. The latter reports to her as to the boss.
- Dostoevsky simultaneously poisoned Mori-san and Director Fukuzawa. Only one can survive - the poison is very specific.
Chuuya opens his mouth to shut up the subordinate. No need to chat in front of Dazai's students! Otherwise, the present Akutagawa will definitely fail. He already dislikes the Agency in general and the tigress in particular. There was still not enough to arrange a fight.
The mafioso stops the hope in the eyes of Koe and Hirotsu. They look at Atsushi as if she can heal the boss this second.
The girl glances at the motionless Ogai, her face contorted with pain. Just for a moment, but more than enough for Chuuya to begin to understand the background behind the boss's order not to kill the tigress in any way. It's not just about the money or the balance of the union, it's about the longing in Mori's dark eyes as he stares at the silver bracelet on Alice's arm.
Atsushi, meanwhile, bends around the mafiosi who are frozen in pillars, rushing to the table.
- Atsushi, - Alice's plaintive voice breaks the silence, no one has ever seen Mori's self-assured talent in such a deplorable state. - You will help him? Will he survive?
The tigress winks at the girl like an old friend.
- Naturally. Where will he go from us!
And Alice cheers up as Atsushi rummages through the boss's desk drawers. With a triumphant cry, the tigress takes out her phone and dials the number.
- An ode to Sakunosuke? Chuuya wonders what the long-dead mafia member has to do with it. Or not lost? I remember Dazai mourned him for a long time. I even went against the boss for him. - Is Tsuna nearby? Pass her a straw, please. Hello Tsu! I need your medical help. Psi-poison, yeah, that one. Yes, I'm waiting.
Atsushi put her phone down, perched on the table. It seemed that she did not feel the slightest shame from the gazes with which the men in the room followed her open slender legs.
- Well, now, in half an hour Tsuna will be in the director's ward.
- Can you heal them? - Alice lets go of something, and she clings to Atsushi, wraps around her waist with a resolute look - you can't tear it off!
- Psi-poison, it must be treated at the same time, - Atsushi drumming his fingers. - I will pull out Mori, we are connected with him, and this is stronger than any prohibitions. You just need to act simultaneously with Tsuna.
- He tried that poison on you. - Chuuya had never seen such a gentle expression on Koe’s face before. The woman hugs Atsushi like a beloved child, protecting her from prying eyes with wide kimono sleeves.
Half an hour later, the phone rattles and tries to escape on vibration. Atsushi puts the headset in his ear and climbs onto the bed, sits on Mori's hips.
- Are you ready? On the count of three!
Mafiosi freeze, now too much depends on the tigress. Chuuya would have rebelled, but he trusts Koya and the older sister trusts this girl. Therefore, he simply keeps Akutagawa from acting unreasonably.
Atsushi gnaws at his wrist, puts it on the man's mouth and makes him swallow blood. Her skin begins to glow with an inner flame, her lips whisper something distant, her name is Mori, like something precious, infinitely loved. It becomes uncomfortable, as if with dirty boots climbed into something fragile, intimate, intimate.
Time freezes and starts running again with Mori's first flick of eyelashes. Cheering screams echo as Chuuya shuts his eyes in relief. He didn’t want to lose his people in the fight with the Agency.
The boss's hand, still weak and pale, is woven into the snow-white hair of the tigress, forcing her to lean forward.
- Last time I forgot to tell you ...
The double whispers across the room:
- Welcome back!
From the other world, from death, unconsciousness.
They will always come back.
