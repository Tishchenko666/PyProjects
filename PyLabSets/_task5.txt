Tom Riddle has always been selfish. He was afraid of death. Afraid of what would follow her. The great wizard Albus Dumbledore thought through everything to the smallest detail. Harry Potter was to die at the hands of Voldemort, destroying all of the Dark Lord's Horcruxes. This was the only way they could win.
It was a plan that only held on to Tom Riddle himself. A plan based on his selfishness and fear ... But Albus Dumbledore left out only one thing. In every form, in every guise, Tom tried to survive.
At any cost.
